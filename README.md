## About
SpotSage is a full-stack web application originally created as my rails project as a student of Flat Iron School. I was inspired by the difficult parking situation here in NYC and wanted to create something that people can actually use to find parking easily. My vision for the app was to make it the airbnb or bookings.com version of parking. Many of my style elements were inspired from airbnb's github style guide.
